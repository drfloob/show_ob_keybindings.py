# show_ob_keybindings.py

The original show_ob_keybindings.py by Joe Bloggs can be found [here on the Openbox website](http://openbox.org/wiki/Openbox:Pipemenus) under "Openbox Configuration".

This version fixes some bugs, employs different design choices, and adds a few features:

 * the user's home directory is now autodetected
 * Labels are now unclickable `separators` instead of `items`
 * shows groups of nested keybinds (chain key) as separate and indented blocks with their own header.
